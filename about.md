I'm an entreprenuer who's curiosity led him to  tech...i wanted the ability to dream and
create in one fell swoop,and web engineering opened that door for me.

Python/Django is my thing, but i also tinker with PHP5,Nodejs, Android and WordPress...plus
any other language that might need to be quickly learnt to make a project happen.

Being a full-stack web engineer makes things move faster and helps to quench my insatiable
curiosity and sense of adventure into the unknown.
